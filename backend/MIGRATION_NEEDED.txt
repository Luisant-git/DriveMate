DATABASE MIGRATION REQUIRED
===========================

Run the following commands to update the database schema:

1. cd backend
2. npx prisma migrate dev --name add_lead_workflow
3. npx prisma generate

This will add the following fields to the Booking model:
- selectedLeadPackageId
- leadResponses (relation)
- allocatedLeadId
- leadId
- lead (relation)

And update LeadBookingResponse to reference Booking instead of LeadBooking.
